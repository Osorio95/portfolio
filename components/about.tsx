                    I am a self-taught front-end developer with 3 years of experience working closely with UX/UI designers and software engineers on demanding projects. My experience has taught me a lot, and I am always looking for new information to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices. I am committed to delivering the best possible results for my clients.

                    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, from modding to immersing myself in complex challenges. I am always up for a challenge! I also enjoy bringing small projects to life, such as Pok√©dexes, small CRUD apps, and others.
